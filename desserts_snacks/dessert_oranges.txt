Dessert Oranges

Ingredients:

-4 medium oranges, peeled and sliced into "circles."
-1 tsp orange flower water
-2 Tbsp sugar
-1/2 tsp cinnamon
-1/4 tsp nutmeg
-pinch of ground cloves

Directions:

Place the sliced oranges on a platter. Sprinkle with the orange flower water. Combine the remaining ingredients and sprinkle on the orange slices. Chill for an hour, then serve.

NOTE:  Navel oranges are easier to peel and fewer seeds than juice oranges, but juice oranges have more flavor. I just slice the peel off with a knife.
