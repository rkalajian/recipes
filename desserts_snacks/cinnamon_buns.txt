Cinnamon Buns

Ingredients:

-1 cup warm milk (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)
-2 eggs, room temperature
-1/3 cup butter or margarine, melted
-4 1/2 cups bread flour
-1 teaspoon salt
-1/2 cup white sugar
-7 grams active dry yeast (1 packet)
-1 cup brown sugar, packed
-2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

-1/3 cup butter, softened
-1 (3 ounce) package cream cheese, softened
-1/4 cup butter, softened
-1 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar
-1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
-1/8 teaspoon salt

Directions:

Dissolve the yeast in the warm milk in a large bowl. Mix in the sugar, margarine, salt, and eggs. Add flour and mix well. Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put in a bowl, cover with moist towel and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. (I like to preheat the oven to maybe 80 degrees then turn it off. I put the covered bowl in there for dough to rise, and it rises beautifully in 1 hour!)

After the dough has doubled in size turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.

Roll dough into a 16x21 inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. (I like to put them a little closer together so that when they rise they are touching; that way when they bake the sides will touch and stay soft. Just a personal preference). Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).

Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.
