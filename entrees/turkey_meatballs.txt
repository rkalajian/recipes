Turkey Meatballs

-1 tablespoons olive oil 
-1 (20 ounce) package ground turkey 
-1 egg, beaten 
-1/3 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs 
-1/2 tsp basil
-1/2 tsp oregano
-1/2 tsp parsley
-1/4 tsp onion powder
-6 good-size cloves garlic
-1/2 tsp salt
-1/8 tsp black pepper
-2 tbsp Parmesan cheese

Directions:

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with olive oil, and place it in the oven while preheating. 

In a medium bowl, mix together the ground turkey, olive oil, egg, bread crumbs, and seasonings  using your hands. Using an ice cream scoop (or melon baller) if possible, form the meat into golf ball sized meatballs. Place about 1 inch apart in the hot baking dish. Press down to flatten the bottom just slightly. 

Bake for 15 minutes in the preheated oven, then turn them over, and continue baking for about 5 more minutes, or until somewhat crispy on the outside. Serve with pasta and sauce or however you'd like.
