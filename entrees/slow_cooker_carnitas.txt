Slow Cooker Carnitas

Original Recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/slow-cooker-carnitas/

Ingredients: 

-2 teaspoon salt
-2 teaspoon garlic powder
-2 teaspoon ground cumin
-1 teaspoon crumbled dried oregano
-1 teaspoon ground coriander
-1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-1 (4 pound) boneless pork shoulder roast
-2 bay leaves
-2 cups chicken/veggie broth

Directions:

Mix together salt, garlic powder, cumin, oregano, coriander, and cinnamon in a bowl. Coat pork with the spice mixture. Place the bay leaves in the bottom of a slow cooker and place the pork on top. Pour the chicken broth around the sides of the pork, being careful not to rinse off the spice mixture.

Cover and cook on Low until the pork shreds easily with a fork, about 10 hours. Turn the meat after it has cooked for 5 hours. When the pork is tender, remove from slow cooker, and shred with two forks. 

Place in roasting pan. Broil under high heat until outside of pork crisps up slightly - about 5-6 minutes total, check and turn every 2-3 minutes.
